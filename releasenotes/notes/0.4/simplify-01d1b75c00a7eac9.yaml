    Adds the `simplify` method to
    :class:`qiskit_nature.second_quantization.operators.SecondQuantizedOp`
    and the `normal_ordered` method to
    :class:`qiskit_nature.second_quantization.operators.FermionicOp`.
    These methods replace `reduce` and `to_normal_order`, which are deprecated.
    The differences between the new and old methods are the following:

    * `simplify` does not perform normal-ordering, while `reduce` does
    * `normal_ordered` simplifies the result, while `to_normal_order` does not
deprecations:

    The following second quantization operator methods are deprecated:

    * :meth:`qiskit_nature.second_quantization.operators.SecondQuantizedOp.reduce`.
      Instead, use :meth:`qiskit_nature.second_quantization.operators.SecondQuantizedOp.simplify`.
    * :meth:`qiskit_nature.second_quantization.operators.FermionicOp.to_normal_order`.
      Instead, use :meth:`qiskit_nature.second_quantization.operators.FermionicOp.normal_ordered`.
