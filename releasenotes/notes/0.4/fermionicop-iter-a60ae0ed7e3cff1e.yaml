    Adds :meth:`qiskit_nature.second_quantization.operators.FermionicOp.terms`.
    This returns an iterable of
    (term, coefficient) pairs describing the terms contained in the operator.
    Each term is a list of tuples of the form (action, index), where the action
    is either "+" or "-" and the index is the integer index of the factor in
    the term.
